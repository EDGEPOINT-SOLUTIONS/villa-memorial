# AGENTS.md — `web` (React/Next.js + TypeScript, all portals + BFF)

> Gab-owned with agent assistance; Keb reviews every PR. Adapted from the exemplar
> (`docs/08-delivery/exemplars/web-AGENTS.md`) at scaffold time; extends the template's
> frontend adaptation (`docs/02-architecture/service-template.md` §"Frontend adaptation").

## Purpose
Single frontend codebase serving all portals (staff · customer · agent) plus the BFF layer.
Per ADR-004 the Next.js server side IS the BFF: fetch · aggregate · reshape · session-manage.
Screens are built **fixtures-first** against recorded contract fixtures so UI work never waits
on backend services.

## Non-negotiable rules (merge blockers)
1. **The BFF stays dumb** (ADR-004 guardrail): no business rules in BFF/route handlers; no data
   writes originate from BFF code. Business logic found here is a defect — move it to the owning
   service.
2. **Fixture↔contract drift fails CI nightly.** Fixtures record REAL response shapes and carry
   provenance comments (`lib/fixtures/README.md`); a service contract change that breaks fixtures
   must update them in the same PR chain — never hand-edit recorded JSON to make tests pass.
3. **Sessions server-side only.** Access tokens live in httpOnly cookies managed by BFF routes
   (`app/api/auth/*`); tokens never reach browser JS, localStorage, or logs.
4. **RBAC gates nav AND actions.** Hiding a button is UX; authorization still happens at
   services. The UI must render graceful 403 states when scopes don't allow an action.
5. **Every async screen has error/empty/loading states per design system before merge**
   (`components/ui/states.tsx`). No bare spinners-only screens.

## Traps (things agents get wrong here)
- Calling services directly from client components — everything goes through BFF route handlers;
  `.env.example` exposes nothing client-side except demo hints.
- Hand-rolling fetch wrappers per component — one typed client per service under `lib/api-client/`;
  regenerate from OpenAPI specs once services publish real ones (identity-access spec is still
  template-generic as of scaffold time).
- Trusting JWT payload shape at runtime without validation — parse defensively via
  `lib/auth/session.ts`; unknown shapes → logged-out state, not a crash.
- Copying tenant-specific vocabulary into shared components — domain terms live in feature
  folders/config; shared kit stays generic (ⓡ discipline applies to UI too).
- Hard-coding colors/sizes in views — every visual decision goes through `styles/tokens.css`
  (design-system.md consumption rule #1).
- **Inventing a shape or a scope ahead of the contract, then not flagging it loudly enough.**
  Fixtures-first is the right pattern — screens must not wait on services — but a fixture
  invented before a freeze becomes the de facto contract by the time anyone reviews it. The
  D3 services ended up ratifying `Lot` and `Case` as Gab wrote them, and `hr:read` /
  `documents:read` were live in shipped code for four days while named in no contract. When
  you invent a shape, say so in the file header (that part was done well) **and** open a
  contract question the same day.
- **A `501 not wired yet` live branch is not a seam, it is a stub.** `property.ts` and
  `operations.ts` threw on live mode while claiming the env var would flip them on. Write the
  real branch behind the flag, or say plainly that live mode is unimplemented.
- **Tolerant readers on the live path.** Upstream JSON is validated field by field
  (`toLot` / `toCase`), extra fields ignored, missing ones surfaced as a 502 — never cast a
  `fetch` result straight to the domain type.

## Self-check commands (before every PR)
```bash
npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm test        # unit + fixture-contract tests
npm run build                                        # production build must pass
docker compose up --build                            # SSR on :3000 against stub-gateway w/ fixtures
```

## Run modes
| Mode | Trigger | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Fixtures (default) | no `AUTH_BASE_URL` | In-process recorded persona responses; unsigned structural tokens |
| Stub compose | `docker compose up --build` | Same fixtures served by `stub-gateway/` mirroring edge-gateway paths |
| Live | `AUTH_BASE_URL=<gateway>` | BFF proxies `${AUTH_BASE_URL}/identity/api/v1/auth/*` |

## Landing page — content-model home (read before touching "/" or its admin)

- The public home (app/page.tsx) is NOT hand-written JSX sections: it renders
  `components/landing/landing-view.tsx` from a LandingPage content document
  (hero · rails · about · services · plans · map · blog copy — the middle column
  renders the live park map BEFORE the newsfeed; keep that order when editing).
  Interior pages keep their own routes/layouts and are untouched.
- Content lives in the fixture store like every module: recorded seed at
  `lib/fixtures/landing/content.json` + in-process saves through
  `lib/api-client/landing.ts` (types/validator are the model authority — rails
  hold UNLIMITED items per side — empty plan/blog lists are legal). The three-
  column anchored shell (fixed 17rem rails + centred 50rem middle) and the
  rail/footer/section styles live in the "anchored catalogue home" block of
  `styles/components.css`; below 75rem the rails collapse into the
  MobileQuickMenu flyout.
- The staff editor is the premium `app/(staff)/staff/landing` page (scope
  catalog:write, reused provisionally); its rail picker catalogue in
  `lib/landing/catalogue.ts` is built from the REAL catalogue/villa-pricing —
  never add a picker option with invented prices. The picker pins one item per
  click or bulk-selects several (choose a rail, switch to bulk pin, pick rows,
  "Pin N items"). The editor's image picker
  offers THREE sources: the uploaded media library, a public URL, or a REAL
  device upload (`components/landing/device-uploader.tsx` + `lib/device-upload.ts`)
  — chosen files are downscaled (max 1600px) into data URLs stored INSIDE the
  content document via the same fixture-store save path (zero backend); blog
  media rows show device photos as a compact attached state, never a base64
  blob in the src input.
- Rendering/robustness tests: `tests/unit/landing-view.test.tsx` (renders the
  view via react-dom/server) + `tests/fixture-contract/landing.test.ts` (pins
  seed prices to lib/villa-pricing.ts). vitest.config compiles .tsx with the
  automatic JSX runtime for those.
- Public lot browse (/lots) filters plots by park, status and legend type; the
  type-filter + live chip counts live in `lib/lots-legend.ts` (pure + unit-
  tested at tests/unit/lots-legend.test.ts) and read types from
  `lib/park-types.ts` — never inline that filter logic in the page.
- **Public chrome is ONE grammar** — every public page (the home AND all
  `(public)` routes) renders the same anchored navigation bar + footer
  (`components/landing/site-header.tsx` SiteHeaderBar + LandingFooter, fed by
  the landing content doc). The home's LandingView stays framework-free (no
  router) — it renders the bar without an active highlight; interior pages add
  aria-current via usePathname + the live cart count in the same component.
  Never introduce a second public header/footer class set; if you must change
  the bar, change SiteHeaderBar + the "anchored catalogue home" CSS block and
  it lands everywhere automatically. The rails hide their scrollbar until
  hovered (.anchored-rail). Blog posts carry an optional `link` (set in the
  "/" editor) that makes the post's photos/caption navigate; seed posts ship
  sensible internal routes.

## Package page — `/plans/[sku]` (design target — read before touching it)

- Package items render the CLIENT's approved layout, not a generic hero. Authority:
  `docs/prototypes/villa-home-ui/package.html` (+ `prototype.css` + its README) —
  captain's 2026-09-16 review: "the exact design of package.html", INCLUDING the
  icon treatment (translucent `--gold-wash` disc + `--gold-700` glyph on BOTH the
  five feature columns and the eligibility/benefit row). That supersedes the older
  `Package page UI example.webp` navy-on-solid-gold deviation. Main column =
  breadcrumb → title/lead/tagline → chips → quote → VILLA MEMORIAL PLAN panel →
  COMPLETE MEMORIAL PACKAGE grid (five columns + the eligibility/benefit row) →
  Official 2026 price list module → "The package at a glance" evidence strip. The
  28rem rail holds the promo card, the tier × term buy card and the advisor card.
  Services/add-ons keep the `hero-premium` layout.
- The price module is route-local
  (`app/(public)/plans/[sku]/price-list-2026-module.tsx`): the prototype's
  "Highlight amortization term" switch + "Highlight senior-citizen rates" toggle
  drive every `data-term`/`.senior` cell, the four family tables keep the prototype's
  grouped two-row header and `caption`, and the source note credits the sheet.
  `/lots/price-list-2026` still renders the older `PriceList2026Tables` cards.
- Embalming is INCLUDED in the package with no fixed day count — never write
  "1 day"/"7 days" in package/pay-plan copy. The client's "2026 price FV website A"
  sheet prices embalming per day (3 days ₱6,000 … 9 days ₱15,000, ₱1,500/day beyond)
  and applies that table only when a family does NOT take a package.
- Theme: the public brand colour is **sky blue** (captain 2026-09-16), applied through
  the `--sky-*` primitives + remapped semantic roles in `styles/tokens.css`. `--navy-*`
  stays the ink/structure ladder and the staff portal's premium navy/gold direction
  (`.app-shell` keeps navy buttons). Home, footer, hero and public surfaces paint
  `--sky-*` with navy ink; gold/brass accents are unchanged.
- Styles live in the "package page" block of `styles/components.css`
  (`.plan-layout` / `.plan-main` / `.plan-side` / `.pkg-*`); the feature icons are
  route-local in `app/(public)/plans/[sku]/package-icons.tsx`. `.plan-main` needs
  its explicit `grid-template-columns: minmax(0, 1fr)` — the implicit track sizes
  to the five-column grid's max-content and overflows the rail otherwise; the
  feature grid reflows 3+2 between 62.001–82rem (the rail still fits at 28rem)
  and 2-across below, so the five columns never crush.
- Never write an amount in the view: `PlanTermSelector` and the price module read
  every price through `planRate()` / `LOT_PRICE_CATEGORIES` in `lib/villa-pricing.ts`
  (tier × term, regular + senior tables; 2026 sheet family captions live there too).
  The prototype wins over every older render.
