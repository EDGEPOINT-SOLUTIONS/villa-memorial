# AGENTS.md — `web` (React/Next.js + TypeScript, all portals + BFF)

> Gab-owned with agent assistance; Keb reviews every PR. Adapted from the exemplar
> (`docs/08-delivery/exemplars/web-AGENTS.md`) at scaffold time; extends the template's
> frontend adaptation (`docs/02-architecture/service-template.md` §"Frontend adaptation").

## Purpose
Single frontend codebase serving all portals (staff · customer · agent) plus the BFF layer.
Per ADR-004 the Next.js server side IS the BFF: fetch · aggregate · reshape · session-manage.
Screens are built **fixtures-first** against recorded contract fixtures so UI work never waits
on backend services.

## Non-negotiable rules (merge blockers)
1. **The BFF stays dumb** (ADR-004 guardrail): no business rules in BFF/route handlers; no data
   writes originate from BFF code. Business logic found here is a defect — move it to the owning
   service.
2. **Fixture↔contract drift fails CI nightly.** Fixtures record REAL response shapes and carry
   provenance comments (`lib/fixtures/README.md`); a service contract change that breaks fixtures
   must update them in the same PR chain — never hand-edit recorded JSON to make tests pass.
3. **Sessions server-side only.** Access tokens live in httpOnly cookies managed by BFF routes
   (`app/api/auth/*`); tokens never reach browser JS, localStorage, or logs.
4. **RBAC gates nav AND actions.** Hiding a button is UX; authorization still happens at
   services. The UI must render graceful 403 states when scopes don't allow an action.
5. **Every async screen has error/empty/loading states per design system before merge**
   (`components/ui/states.tsx`). No bare spinners-only screens.

## Traps (things agents get wrong here)
- Calling services directly from client components — everything goes through BFF route handlers;
  `.env.example` exposes nothing client-side except demo hints.
- Hand-rolling fetch wrappers per component — one typed client per service under `lib/api-client/`;
  regenerate from OpenAPI specs once services publish real ones (identity-access spec is still
  template-generic as of scaffold time).
- Trusting JWT payload shape at runtime without validation — parse defensively via
  `lib/auth/session.ts`; unknown shapes → logged-out state, not a crash.
- Copying tenant-specific vocabulary into shared components — domain terms live in feature
  folders/config; shared kit stays generic (ⓡ discipline applies to UI too).
- Hard-coding colors/sizes in views — every visual decision goes through `styles/tokens.css`
  (design-system.md consumption rule #1).
- **Inventing a shape or a scope ahead of the contract, then not flagging it loudly enough.**
  Fixtures-first is the right pattern — screens must not wait on services — but a fixture
  invented before a freeze becomes the de facto contract by the time anyone reviews it. The
  D3 services ended up ratifying `Lot` and `Case` as Gab wrote them, and `hr:read` /
  `documents:read` were live in shipped code for four days while named in no contract. When
  you invent a shape, say so in the file header (that part was done well) **and** open a
  contract question the same day.
- **A `501 not wired yet` live branch is not a seam, it is a stub.** `property.ts` and
  `operations.ts` threw on live mode while claiming the env var would flip them on. Write the
  real branch behind the flag, or say plainly that live mode is unimplemented.
- **Tolerant readers on the live path.** Upstream JSON is validated field by field
  (`toLot` / `toCase`), extra fields ignored, missing ones surfaced as a 502 — never cast a
  `fetch` result straight to the domain type.

## Self-check commands (before every PR)
```bash
npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm test        # unit + fixture-contract tests
npm run build                                        # production build must pass
docker compose up --build                            # SSR on :3000 against stub-gateway w/ fixtures
```

## Run modes
| Mode | Trigger | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Fixtures (default) | no `AUTH_BASE_URL` | In-process recorded persona responses; unsigned structural tokens |
| Stub compose | `docker compose up --build` | Same fixtures served by `stub-gateway/` mirroring edge-gateway paths |
| Live | `AUTH_BASE_URL=<gateway>` | BFF proxies `${AUTH_BASE_URL}/identity/api/v1/auth/*` |
